# Decontextualized Emotion Recognition

## Overview

This project explores whether emotion can be computationally recognized under decontextualized conditions.

We fine-tune a ResNet18 model on a curated facial dataset and compare predictions across original, cropped, and grayscale images to examine contextual influence.
